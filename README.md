. By leveraging **BASE blockchain technology** Sound-Stake rewards fans/users with tokens.

### Key Features

- **Staking for Music Projects**: Fans can stake tokens to support a specific artist or music project, becoming early backers. These tokens then represent their share in the revenue generated through which they can earn on the basis of the songs reach.This allows fans to have a stake in the success of the music they love.

- **Fair Revenue Distribution**: Revenue generated from streams, sales, or other income sources is distributed directly to artists, stakeholders, and fans who have staked in the project. This is done transparently using smart contracts, ensuring that everyone receives their fair share without delays.

- **Artist Empowerment**: Artists maintain creative control and ownership of their work. They can fund their projects by raising capital from their fan base through staking, bypassing traditional gatekeepers like record labels and streaming platforms.
The platform gives artists direct access to their fans, allowing them to build stronger, more engaged communities.

- **Decentralization and Transparency**: Using blockchain technology, the platform offers full transparency into how revenue is generated, distributed, and shared. Smart contracts automatically execute the distribution of funds, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
Both artists and fans can track and verify the flow of funds and staking rewards in realtime.
